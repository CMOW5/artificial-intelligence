    """
    Complete the implementation of the shortest_path function such that it returns the shortest path from the person with id source to the person with the id target

    - Assuming there is a path from the source to the target, your function should return a list, where each list item is the next (movie_id, person_id) 
    pair in the path from the source to the target. Each pair should be a tuple of two strings

    For example, if the return value of shortest_path were [(1, 2), (3, 4)], that would mean that the source starred in movie 1 with person 2, 
    person 2 starred in movie 3 with person 4, and person 4 is the target.

    - If there are multiple paths of minimum length from the source to the target, your function can return any of them.
    
    - If there is no possible path between two actors, your function should return None

    - You may call the neighbors_for_person function, which accepts a personâ€™s id as input, and returns a set of (movie_id, person_id) pairs for all people 
    who starred in a movie with a given person.
